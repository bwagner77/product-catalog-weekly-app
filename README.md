# Product Catalog (SDD Weekly Project)

⚠️ This is a milestone submission for the SDD Weekly Project, not the Final Project version.  

The Product Catalog is a simple web application that displays a list of products with names, descriptions, and prices. It fetches data from a backend API and presents it in a responsive, accessible interface. The app includes unit tests for frontend and backend, ensuring functionality and code quality. It is fully built using **GitHub Spec Kit**, with no manual coding, allowing automated generation of components, tasks, and tests.

This document follows the **Spec Kit Detailed Workflow**:

> Initialize → Constitution → Specify → Plan → Tasks → Implement (via Agents) → Validate → Containerize & Deploy → Document Everything

It outlines each step of the build process, including commands, validations, and output artifacts.

## 📊 Specification (SDD)

### Goals & Why

The primary goal is to provide an **intuitive, accessible, and responsive experience** for users browsing products. The system fully leverages GitHub Spec Kit for automated generation, ensuring consistency, reducing human error, and accelerating development.

1. **Display Product Information**: Users can view products with name, description, and price.
   *Why*: Core functionality, ensures informed decisions.

2. **Responsive UI**: Interface must be intuitive, visually appealing, and display products correctly.
   *Why*: Fast, responsive UI improves user experience; page load <2s.

3. **Error Handling**: Display "No products available" if no products exist.
   *Why*: Provides clear user guidance during failures.

4. **Accessibility**: Full keyboard navigation and ARIA compliance.
   *Why*: Broadens potential user base to include users with disabilities.

5. **Performance**: API <1s, UI load <2s.
   *Why*: Crucial for user satisfaction and engagement.

## 🧾 User Journeys

### Use Case 1 – View Product List

* **Goal**: Shopper browses available products.
* **Actors**: Shopper
* **Steps**:

  1. Open catalog page.
  2. System retrieves product list from API.
  3. Display products (name, description, price).
  4. Layout adapts to device screen.
* **Acceptance**: All seeded products visible; page load ≤2s.

### Use Case 2 – Handle Loading, Empty, Error States

* **Goal**: Shopper wants feedback while loading, empty, or error states.
* **Steps**:

  1. Loading indicator while API request pending.
  2. Show "No products available" if empty.
  3. Show actionable error message if API fails.
* **Acceptance**: Clear feedback in all states.

### Use Case 3 – Accessibility & Responsiveness

* **Goal**: Shopper with assistive tech or mobile device can navigate catalog.
* **Steps**:

  1. Navigate using keyboard only.
  2. Use screen reader; details exposed correctly.
  3. Layout adapts to small screen.
* **Acceptance**: Full keyboard/screen reader access; responsive layout.



## 📊 Constraints (Constitution)

1. **Fixed Stack**: Must use specified frameworks; deviations require Constitution amendment.
2. **Code Quality & Testing**: ≥80% coverage; tests run automatically in CI; all tests must pass.
3. **Continuous Integration**: All branches pass CI, including linting, formatting, tests.
4. **Development Workflow**: Tasks follow MVP-first prioritization, small units, PR compliance.
5. **Governance & Versioning**: Amendments require PR with rationale; Constitution is authoritative.

*Rationale*: Ensures consistency, reliability, reproducibility, and governance adherence.



## 🛠️ Plan → Tasks → Implement

### Plan

- **API & Storage**: TypeScript + Express API `GET /api/products` with MongoDB.
- **Data Contracts**: Product schema (`id`, `name`, `description`, `price`) with OpenAPI specification.
- **Frontend**: React 18 + Vite + TailwindCSS; responsive, accessible product list.
- **Seeding**: ≥5 sample products, idempotent insertion.
- **Performance & Constraints**: ≤100 products, no pagination; UI render ≤2s, API ≤1s.
