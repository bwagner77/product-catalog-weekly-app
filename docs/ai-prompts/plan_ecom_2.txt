I have a plan.md and tasks.md for an extended e-commerce MVP. 

Currently, stock decrement on order submission is marked out-of-scope in both:
- "Out-of-Scope" section in plan.md
- Future / Not In Scope Tasks list (D004)

I now want stock decrement to be **in-scope**. Please:

1. Remove all mentions that stock decrement is out-of-scope (plan.md and deferred tasks).  
2. Update **Phase 11 (Order Submission)** to:
   - Implement stock decrement on order submission
   - Validate sufficient stock (reject order if insufficient)
   - Add backend tests for stock decrement, insufficient stock, and post-order stock consistency
   - Update frontend tests if needed (cart / order confirmation)
3. Update **Completion Criteria** in plan.md to include stock decrement implementation & tests.
4. Remove D004 from “Future / Not In Scope Tasks” section.
5. Keep everything else unchanged (formatting, task IDs, other features).  

Return the full **updated plan.md** and **updated Phase 11 tasks** in tasks.md.
