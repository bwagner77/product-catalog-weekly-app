Generate a detailed technical implementation plan building on the existing `001-product-catalog` plan, based on the following specifications:

---

Specifications Overview
- **Frontend**: React 18 app with TypeScript, Vite, and TailwindCSS. Displays products, supports search/filter, category selection, stock status, shopping cart (stored in localStorage), and order submission. All data is fetched from the backend API except cart which is localStorage-based.
- **Backend**: Express API with TypeScript, featuring multiple endpoints:
  - `GET /api/products` – list all products with optional filters (category, search term). Out-of-stock products are still returned; frontend disables add-to-cart for them.
  - `GET /api/categories` – full CRUD for categories.
  - `POST /api/orders` – submit a new order; updates stock counts in the backend.
- **MongoDB Schema**:
  - **Product**: `name`, `description`, `price`, `categoryId`, `stock` (integer), `createdAt`, `updatedAt`, immutable `id` (UUID). Seed ≥20 products for realistic store.
  - **Category**: `name`, `description`, immutable `id` (UUID), `createdAt`, `updatedAt`.
  - **Order**: snapshot of products and totals, timestamp, immutable `id` (UUID). Stock counts updated on order creation.
  - All schemas must support idempotent seeding on first run.
- **Application Scope**: 
  - Products: read-only
  - Categories: full CRUD
  - Orders: create-only
  - Cart: frontend localStorage only
- **Exclusions**: No authentication, caching/CDN, image processing, or advanced analytics.
- **Containerization**: Docker Compose for frontend, backend, and MongoDB. One-command environment spin-up.
- **Performance Goals**:
  - Frontend render: ≤1s typical (p95), goal ≤2s
  - API response: ≤1s typical (p95)
  - Order submission: ≤500ms typical

Implementation Sections

1. **Database Setup**
   - Extend MongoDB schemas for Product, Category, and Order using TypeScript + Mongoose.
   - Include timestamps and immutable UUIDs (`id`) for all entities.
   - Ensure idempotent seeding for products (≥20) and categories (≥5).
   - Implement stock tracking; order creation decreases stock counts.
   - Seed logic checks for existing entries before inserting.
   - Files: `backend/src/models/` and `backend/src/seed/`.

2. **Backend API Development**
   - Implement endpoints:
     - `GET /api/products` with optional filters (category, search term); includes out-of-stock products.
     - `GET /api/categories` with full CRUD.
     - `POST /api/orders` for order creation; updates stock counts.
   - Include traceId middleware, logging, and error handling (400/404/500).
   - Lean queries for MongoDB interactions.
   - Ensure TypeScript type safety and proper ts-node-dev CLI flags.
   - Add CORS support for frontend URL.
   - Files:
     - `backend/src/routes/products.ts`
     - `backend/src/routes/categories.ts`
     - `backend/src/routes/orders.ts`
     - `backend/src/models/*.ts`
     - `backend/src/seed/*.ts`
     - `backend/src/utils/traceId.ts`

3. **Frontend Development**
   - Use Vite + React 18 + TypeScript + TailwindCSS.
   - Pages/Components:
     - ProductList, ProductCard, Loading, ErrorMessage, EmptyState, CategoryFilter, SearchBar, CartSidebar, OrderSummary, CategoryManagement.
   - Fetch data via `import.meta.env.VITE_API_BASE_URL`.
   - Filters/search query backend; stock = 0 disables add-to-cart.
   - Cart stored in **localStorage**; add/remove/update items with real-time totals.
   - Orders submit cart snapshot; display order confirmation.
   - Files:
     - `frontend/src/pages/` and `frontend/src/components/`
     - `frontend/src/api/*.ts` for each entity (products, categories, orders)

4. **Testing**
   - Frontend tests in `frontend/src/__tests__/` including rendering, loading, error, stock, cart, order, accessibility.
   - Backend tests in `backend/tests/` covering API endpoints, model validation, seed idempotency, stock updates, category CRUD.
   - Unit + integration tests with coverage ≥80% on critical paths.
   - Backend: Jest + Supertest; Frontend: Vitest + React Testing Library (RTL).

5. **Performance Validation**
   - Manual local tests for render times, API latency, cart operations, order submission.
   - Document p95 metrics in `research.md`.

6. **Containerization**
   - Docker Compose for frontend (5173), backend (3000), MongoDB (27017).
   - Map `.env` files correctly; use build args for frontend API URL.
   - Add `/health` endpoints for health checks.

7. **Technical Context Updates**
   - Maintain TypeScript, TailwindCSS, ESLint, Prettier.
   - Ensure strict typing across frontend and backend.
   - Add npm run dev scripts for frontend and backend.
   - Ensure Vite proxy for API requests.

8. **Constitution Alignment**
   - Manual testing only, CI/CD deferred.
   - Ensure performance, accessibility, modularity, and coverage align with constitution.

Additional Notes
- Product volume ≤100 items; pagination optional.
- Cart stored in frontend localStorage.
- Stock updates occur only on order submission.
- Filters/search query the backend.
- ESLint + Prettier enforced consistently.
