Please update and extend the existing Product Catalog plan in
`plans/001-product-catalog/plan.md` to align with the current state of the code
and the new Shoply requirements. Do NOT create a new plan; update in place.

Apply the following changes/tasks:

## 1. Frontend Cleanup

- In `frontend/src/App.tsx`, there are two `import React from 'react';` statements.
  Remove the duplicate so only one remains.

## 2. Seed Data Updates

- The first 5 seeded products were missing the `imageUrl` and `stock` fields.
  Add these fields:
  - `imageUrl`: placeholder value following the pattern `"product<N>.jpg"` consistent with existing seeds.
  - `stock`: non-negative integer; use `5` for each of these first 5 products.
- Verify that all other seeded products already have valid `imageUrl` and `stock`.

## 3. Order Confirmation Modal

- Current order confirmation modal/dialog has only the top-right X button.
- Add an explicit "Close" button within the modal that also dismisses it.
- Update tasks/tests to reflect that the modal can be closed via either mechanism.

## 4. Category Management Navigation

- There is a `frontend/src/pages/CategoryManagement.tsx` page with full category CRUD.
- Add routing/navigation so users can access this page via the navbar.
- Ensure plan tasks include testing navigation reachability.

## 5. Navigation Banner Branding

- Update top banner branding:
  - Change app name from "Product Catalog" → "Shoply".
  - Add an image/logo to the left of the brand name (e.g., `public/images/logo.svg`).
- Update tasks to verify accessibility of brand/logo and navigation.

## 6. Plan & Task Integration

- Merge these new tasks into the existing plan while preserving previous entries, priorities, and formatting.
- Ensure that all tasks are actionable and include references to files, components, or tests where relevant.
- Maintain task numbering or add new ones following the existing convention.

**Goal:** Produce an updated plan that reflects frontend cleanup, seeded product consistency, order modal improvements, CategoryManagement navigation, and Shoply branding/logo updates, while preserving prior plan context and tasks.
