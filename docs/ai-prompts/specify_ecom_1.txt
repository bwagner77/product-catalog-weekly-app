Please update and extend the existing Product Catalog specification in specs/001-product-catalog/ 
to support a lightweight e-commerce feature set. 
Do NOT create a new folder. Extend the current spec in place.

Add the following new functional areas:

## 1. Product Enhancements
- Add a new field to Product: categoryId (string).
- Add a new field to Product: stock (number).
- Update the Product List UI to display stock status (“In Stock” or “Out of Stock”).
- Add validation: stock must be >= 0.

## 2. Category Management
Create a new Category entity with:
- id (string)
- name (string)

Backend:
- Expose CRUD endpoints:
  - GET /api/categories
  - GET /api/categories/:id
  - POST /api/categories
  - PUT /api/categories/:id
  - DELETE /api/categories/:id

Frontend:
- Add a Category Management page that lists categories in a table with columns: id, name, actions (edit/delete).
- Include a form for creating and editing categories with a single field: name (required).
- Add a category dropdown/filter to the product list page.

## 3. Product Search
Extend GET /api/products to accept query parameters:
- search: text search on name and description.
- categoryId: filter products by category.

Frontend:
- Add a search bar that triggers backend search.

## 4. Client-Side Shopping Cart
Cart is stored in React state + persisted in localStorage.

Features:
- Add product to cart.
- Remove product from cart.
- Update quantity.
- Display item count in a CartIcon component.
- Cart persists when browser refreshes.

React components/pages:
- CartPage showing item list, quantity controls, total price.
- CartItem component.
- CartIcon showing item count.
- OrderSummary section.

## 5. Basic Order Submission
Create an Order entity:
- id (string)
- items: array of { productId, name, price, quantity }
- total (number)
- status: "submitted"
- createdAt (datetime)

Backend:
- POST /api/orders: creates a new order.
- GET /api/orders/:id: returns the order.

Frontend:
- "Place Order" button on CartPage.
- Order Confirmation page displaying order details.

## 6. Testing
Backend tests must cover:
- Product search
- Category CRUD
- Order creation

Frontend tests must cover:
- Cart state updates
- Search behavior
- Category filter
- Cart persistence (localStorage)

## 7. Nonfunctional Requirements
- UI must remain responsive and accessible.
- No authentication required.
- Assume ≤ 200 products; no pagination.

Please merge these requirements into the existing spec while preserving all previous content and produce an updated unified specification.
