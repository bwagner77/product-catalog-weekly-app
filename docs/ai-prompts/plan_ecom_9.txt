**Please update the existing `plan.md` for the `Shoply Product Catalog` in place.**

### Goal:

Make the following updates to the current plan:

1. **Rename the button in `App.tsx` from "Categories" to "Category Management".**
2. **Reorder the buttons in `App.tsx` to the following:**

   * Products
   * Category Management
   * Product Management
   * Logout
3. **Modify the behavior of the `ProductCard` component:**

   * After completing an order, if the product stock quantity is decremented to zero, the `ProductCard` should display "Out of Stock" and disable the "Add to Cart" button.

### Requirements:

* **Task Breakdown Updates**: Add/update tasks in the **Task Breakdown** section of the plan to reflect the following:

  * Renaming and reordering buttons in the navigation.
  * Modifying the `ProductCard` behavior based on stock availability.
* **Do not replace or remove any existing sections**, such as:

  * Metadata (`Branch`, `Date`, `Spec`)
  * Summary
  * Technical Context
  * Phase Plan
  * Existing tasks or implementation notes, except where related to the new requirements above.

### Expected Outcome:

* Only the relevant tasks and details regarding the renaming of the button, reordering of buttons, and product stock behavior will be **added or updated**.
* **No sections** (like metadata, summary, etc.) will be removed or replaced.
