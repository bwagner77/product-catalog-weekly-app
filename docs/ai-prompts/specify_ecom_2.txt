Please update and extend the existing Product Catalog specification in specs/001-product-catalog/ 
to support product images. 
Do NOT create a new folder. Extend the current spec in place.

Add the following new functional areas:

## 1. Product Image Field
- Add a new field to Product: `imageUrl` (string).
- During seeding, assign placeholder values following a consistent pattern: "product1.jpg", "product2.jpg", etc.
- Ensure all Product entities in the backend include this field.
- Validation: `imageUrl` must be a non-empty string.

## 2. Frontend Product Display
- Update the ProductCard component to display the product image using `imageUrl`:
  <img src={product.imageUrl} alt={product.name} />
- Maintain existing display of name, description, price, and stock status.
- All product images must have consistent width and height (e.g., 200x200px) and maintain aspect ratio using object-fit: cover.
- Images must be responsive; use max-width: 100% in grid/list views.
- Provide a fallback placeholder image of the same dimensions if `imageUrl` is missing.

## 3. Backend & API
- Ensure GET /api/products and all product-related endpoints return `imageUrl` in responses.
- Update seed scripts to populate the `imageUrl` field with the placeholder filenames.
- No actual image file generation is required; assume images exist in a public/static folder.

## 4. Testing

Backend tests:
- Verify `imageUrl` is present and valid in all product documents returned by GET /api/products.
- Verify seeding logic assigns correct `imageUrl` values.

Frontend tests:
- Verify ProductCard renders the image correctly for all products.
- Verify fallback image is displayed if `imageUrl` is missing.
- Verify responsiveness and consistent sizing of images.
- Ensure existing tests for product name, price, and stock status still pass.

## 5. Nonfunctional Requirements
- Images must not break layout; maintain responsive UI.
- No changes to authentication or other business logic.
- Product volume remains ≤200; pagination optional.

Please merge these requirements into the existing spec while preserving all previous content and produce an updated unified specification.
