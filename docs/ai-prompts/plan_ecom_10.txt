Please **update** the existing **`plan.md`** in `/plans/001-product-catalog/plan.md` **in place** to include the following updates related to collapsing the navigation buttons into a **hamburger menu** on smaller/mobile devices.
Do NOT create a new:

---

### **Goal:**

Update `plan.md` to include tasks for implementing a **hamburger menu** for the navigation buttons (Products, Category Management, Product Management, Logout) on **small/mobile screens**. Ensure accessibility and correct functionality on mobile devices.

---

### **New Tasks to Add:**

#### 1. **Hamburger Menu Implementation**:

* **Collapse Navigation**: On small screens (e.g., `max-width: 768px`), collapse the following navigation buttons into a hamburger menu:

  * Products
  * Category Management
  * Product Management (admin only)
  * Logout
* **Hamburger Button Behavior**:

  * Clicking the hamburger button should toggle the visibility of the menu items.
  * The menu items should display vertically when the menu is expanded.
* **Accessibility**:

  * Implement appropriate `aria` attributes (e.g., `aria-expanded`, `aria-controls`, etc.) to indicate the state of the hamburger menu (expanded/collapsed).
  * Ensure that all menu items are keyboard accessible when the menu is open (focusable, `aria-current`, etc.).

#### 2. **Routing and State Behavior**:

* Ensure the hamburger menu items function correctly and allow for smooth navigation when selected.
* Ensure focus is correctly managed when toggling the hamburger menu and when interacting with the menu items (e.g., maintaining focus on the active link, `Escape` closes the menu, etc.).

#### 3. **Testing**:

* **Hamburger Menu Interaction**:

  * Add tasks to simulate clicking the hamburger button and test that the menu items toggle visibility.
  * Verify that the active link (`aria-current`) is correctly displayed.
* **Accessibility Testing**:

  * Write tests to check that `aria-expanded`, `aria-controls`, and other relevant `aria` attributes are correctly applied to the hamburger button and menu.
  * Test that keyboard navigation works inside the hamburger menu (tabbing through the menu, `Escape` to close).
* **Responsive Layout Testing**:

  * Test that the hamburger menu behaves correctly at the mobile breakpoint (`max-width: 768px`), ensuring the regular navigation buttons are hidden and the hamburger button appears.
