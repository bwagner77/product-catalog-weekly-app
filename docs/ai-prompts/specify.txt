# Product Catalog Specification

## Project Overview

Develop a simple Product Catalog application. The goal is to allow users to view a list of products, including basic details like the product name, description, and price. This is a static catalog with no user authentication or other user actions like creating or updating products.

### Key Features:
1. Product List Display:
   - The application should show a list of products with the following attributes for each product:
     - Name (string)
     - Description (string)
     - Price (decimal number)
   
2. Fetch Product Data:
   - Product data will be fetched from a backend API and displayed on the frontend. The product list should be presented in a clean, organized manner.

3. Backend API:
   - A backend API will expose a single endpoint that returns the list of products:
     - `GET /api/products` – Returns a list of products from the database in JSON format.
   
4. Data Storage:
   - The application will use a persistent database to store product data.

## Functional Specifications:

### Frontend:
- As a user, I want to view a list of products with details such as name, description, and price.
- The products should be fetched from an API and displayed in a readable, structured format.
- The UI MUST be clean, responsive, and accessible.
- The products will be displayed in a simple, clean UI (e.g., a list with product names, descriptions, and prices).
- Product prices MUST be formatted with two decimal places and a currency symbol.
- All frontend tests MUST be placed in frontend/src/__tests__/. This includes rendering, accessibility, and utility tests.

### Backend:
- As a developer, I want to expose a `GET /api/products` endpoint to return all products stored in the database.
- All backend tests MUST be placed in backend/tests/. This includes unit tests, integration tests, and seed logic validation.
- The endpoint should return the products as a JSON array containing the following attributes for each product:
  - `name`: String
  - `description`: String
  - `price`: Decimal number (float or double, depending on pricing requirements).

### Database:
- The system MUST store product data in a collection named `products` in a persistent database.
- Each product in the database will have the following schema:
  - `name`: String
  - `description`: String
  - `price`: A decimal number representing the product’s cost, formatted to two decimal places.
- At least 5 sample products should be pre-loaded in the database to display when the app is first loaded.

## Clarification Notes:
- Frontend: No advanced interactions (e.g., no login, no CRUD actions). It will simply display the products.
- Backend: Only a `GET /api/products` endpoint is required for this stage. No other endpoints (e.g., for adding or modifying products) will be needed.
- No user authentication or authorization should be implemented.
- The application will be static, meaning there will be no dynamic features beyond fetching data from the API and displaying it.

## Notes:
- This is a simplified version of the product catalog. Future iterations may involve CRUD operations, user authentication, etc.
