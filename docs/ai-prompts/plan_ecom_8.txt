Please update and extend the existing Product Catalog plan in
`plans/001-product-catalog/plan.md` **in-place** to include the following updates related to the ProductManagement page and RBAC/admin CRUD enforcement:

# Instruction for Spec Kit to Update plan.md

### Goal:
Update `plan.md` to reflect the creation of the `ProductManagement.tsx` page, routing, and access control logic for admin users only. This will include hiding admin-only UI components for non-admin users and testing all related functionality.

### Requirements:

#### 1. ProductManagement Page
- **Page Creation**: Add tasks to create `ProductManagement.tsx` in `frontend/src/pages/`.
  - This page should allow for full CRUD functionality of products, including fields like:
    - `name`
    - `description`
    - `price`
    - `imageUrl`
    - `stock`
    - `categoryId` (with a dropdown of categories)
  - The page should fetch product data from the backend API and allow the admin to modify it.

#### 2. Routing Setup
- **Add Routing**: In `frontend/src/App.tsx`, add the route for `/admin/product-management`.
  - This route should be protected by a `PrivateRoute` that ensures only authenticated users with the `admin` role can access it.

#### 3. Admin Access Control
- **Access Control**:
  - Implement a `PrivateRoute` component to restrict access to `ProductManagement` for authenticated admins only.
  - Non-admin users or unauthenticated users should be redirected to the login page with a branded "Access Denied" message.
  - The `ProductManagement` link should only be visible in the NavBar for admins.

#### 4. UI Hiding for Non-Admins
- **Navbar Modification**: In `frontend/src/components/NavBar.tsx`, hide the `ProductManagement` link for non-admin users. 
  - Admin users should see the link; others should not.

#### 5. Testing
- **Test CRUD Operations**:
  - Create tasks for testing CRUD operations in `ProductManagement` for admins only.
  - Ensure tests for admin role-based access control, including:
    - Successful CRUD operations when logged in as an admin.
    - Blocked access for non-admin users, with “Access Denied” messaging.

---

### Expected Outcome:
1. Generate tasks to create the `ProductManagement` page.
2. Add routing for the `/admin/product-management` page with role-based access control.
3. Update the Navbar to conditionally hide the `ProductManagement` link for non-admin users.
4. Add tests to ensure correct functionality, including access control, CRUD actions, and UI hiding.

### Next Step:
Run this prompt to generate tasks for the above steps and update `plan.md` with the correct details.
