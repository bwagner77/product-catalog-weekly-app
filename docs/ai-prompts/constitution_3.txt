version_bump: "MINOR"
rationale: |
  Add high-level guiding principles for authentication, role-based access, and admin CRUD functionality, ensuring secure and clear user experience while keeping implementation details in the spec and plan.

III. User Experience Consistency

The UI MUST be simple, intuitive, and responsive.

- Mobile-first, responsive layout that adapts from phones to desktops.
- Use TailwindCSS for all layout and styling; no custom color palettes or CSS.
- Provide clear visual feedback for user actions (loading, validation, states).
- Error messages MUST be clear and actionable (e.g., "Product out of stock").
- Key pages should load in under 2 seconds.
- Ensure accessibility by following WCAG guidelines (ARIA, keyboard navigation, color contrast).
- The product’s brand identity is **Shoply** and MUST be used consistently across navigation, titles, and user-facing text.
- The main navigation bar MUST display the brand name **Shoply** and a logo in a consistent, accessible layout.
- Application-wide modals MUST include an accessible, easily discoverable dismissal mechanism (e.g., close icon + button).
- The system MUST support **multiple user roles**:
  - **Anonymous users** can browse products and read content without login.
  - **Admin users** MUST authenticate before accessing sensitive pages.
- Pages involving sensitive operations (e.g., CategoryManagement, ProductManagement) MUST be **restricted to authorized admin users**, with a clear "Access Denied" message or safe redirect for unauthorized users.
- Feedback on authentication, authorization, and restricted actions MUST be **clear, actionable, and consistent with Shoply branding**.

Rationale: Protecting sensitive operations ensures security and trust while maintaining a smooth browsing experience for anonymous users.

VI. Technology Choices & Constraints

The system MUST use a consistent, modern stack suitable for rapid MVP development. All technologies MUST be mature, widely adopted, and support modularity, testing, and containerization.

- Seed data MUST remain schema-complete and updated whenever persistent schema fields evolve.
- The system MUST support **role-based access control**, clearly distinguishing between anonymous and admin users.
- Administrative functions, including CRUD for products and categories, MUST be **restricted to authorized admin users** to maintain data integrity.
- Any new pages or features MUST be evaluated for **role-based restrictions** and documented in the spec.

Rationale: Clear separation of user roles and restricted operations maintains system security, prevents accidental data modification, and enforces operational discipline.
